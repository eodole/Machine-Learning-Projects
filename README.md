# Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects from CS:5430 Machine Learning.
Each project is in its own folder and contains the pdf of the homework the project comes from. 


__Project 1: Document Term Matrix__

Short project using numpy to create a document term matrix that helps to identify which documents have the most words in common with a given query. This projects goal is to emulate a naive search engine. 

__Project 2: Boston House Prices__

Use scikit-learn to predict Boston Housing prices. 

__Project 3: kNN and Naive Bayes__

Use scikit learn to do kth nearest neighbor classification, Naive Bayes implementation not included

__Project 4: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine__

Used liblinear and scikit learn to do classification, also implemented 3 preprocessing methods: scaling, standardization and normalization.
